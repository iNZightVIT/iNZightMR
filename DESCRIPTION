Description: Interaction and analysis of multiple response data,
    along with other tools for analysing these types of data including
    missing value analysis and calculation of standard errors for
    a range of covariance matrix results (proportions, multinomial,
    independent samples, and multiple response). Methods are based on
    the work of Scott and Seber (1983) <doi:10.2307/2682774>
    and Wild and Seber (1994) <doi:10.2307/2684972>.
